                        <l>Our late Sr Rachel Brook was </l>
                        <l>born Apr. 28th 1744 at Birstol.</l>
                        <l>Her Parents, who loved the Lord</l>
                        <l>directed her from her earliest</l>
                        <l>years to the friend of Children </l>
                        <l>and took her, when a Child to the</l>
                        <l>Chaple at Gumersal, where she at</l>
                        <l>tended the Childrens meetings, and </l>
                        <l>and used to be delighted to hear</l>
                        <l>of our Saviours love, and when</l>
                        <l>comming home she would some</l>
                        <l>time kneel down in a corner</l>
                        <l>and pray to him to bless her</l>
                        <l>and form her to his mind.</l>
                        <l>But When she grew older she found</l>
                        <l>that tender Childlike love to our </l>
                        <l>growing cold, she wished to injoy</l>

                        <l>but always felt a monitor within,</l>
                        <l>warning her from going the broad</l>

                        <l>trouble of mind, not willing to</l>
                        <l>follow the Lord, and full of fear</l>
                        <l>to be last eternally; during this</l>
                        <l>period, which was in her 16th</l>
                        <l>year, she had a very remarkable</l>
                        <l>dream: it was to her as if she </l>
                        <l>saw our Saviour on the Cross, in</l>
                        <l>the most lovely attitude, saying</l>
                        <l>to her, &quot;all my sufferings, wounds</l>
                        <l>and bruises were for thee, to</l>
                        <l>save and redeem thy sinful soul.&quot;</l>
                        <l>This made a deep impression on her</l>
                        <l>mind, and she turned in earnest</l>
                        <l>prayer to the Lord, that he would</l>
                        <l>pardon her sins and transgressions</l>
                        <l>and renew a right spirit within</l>
                        <l>her, &amp; once when walking in a field</l>
                        <l>by herself, with tears and prayer</l>
                        <l>lifting up her hands to him, she</l>
                        <l>got an assurance that her guilt</l>
                        <l>should be done away, and that</l>
                        <l>he would prove her good Shepherd</l>

                        <l>with unwearied faithfulness.</l>
                        <l>This has followed all her life and </l>
                        <l>often thro&apos; grace been renewed.</l>
                        <l>She now felt a desire to be closer</l>
                        <l>united with the Brns Congn and </l>
                        <l>to injoy the priviliges of the same.</l>
                        <l>Oct 4th 1760 she moved into the</l>
                        <l>Srs House here in Fulnek, May 11.</l>
                        <l>1761 she was recd into the Brns Congn</l>

                        <l>partook for the first time of</l>
                        <l>the H. Comn. She often spoke</l>
                        <l>with great pleasure, of the time</l>
                        <l>of her first comming, how happy</l>
                        <l>she was in communion with our</l>

                        <l>Srs were together in the so called</l>
                        <l>spinning days, and how they delighted</l>

                        <l>praises of the Lord. She was</l>

                        <l>with Sisters. In 1790 she was accepted </l>
                        <l>atcoluth, and for 18 years she held</l>
                        <l>the Office of Houseservant, she </l>
                        <l>showed much faithfulness in what</l>
                        <l>was committed to her, and looked</l>

                        <l>they were willing to lend her a</l>

                        <l>our Saviour, and with Childlike</l>
                        <l>confidence and humble faith looked</l>

                        <l>into this house, she expressed</l>
                        <l>herself that she could not suffi</l>
                        <l>ciently thank our Saviour, for all</l>
