					<p> serving, through the kind care of the lover of my soul, as a barrier, which
						prevented me from rushing into misery. <date when-iso="1734">In the year 1734</date> I was sent by my

						dead, as my conscience forced immediatly this question upon me: what would
						have be come of you if this had been your case? I hastened to my room
						<name type="emotion">trembling, and throwing myself on the ground, and prayed</name> to an unknown <persName type="diety">God</persName>
						for Grace and conver sion of heart from sin. But sometime after I fell again
						into a dilatory track. In the year 1735 I went to the university <note

					</p>

					<p> at Jena, on which occasion I prayed to God with a concerned heart to
						preserve me from seduction and convert me. This prayer I repeated very often
						as I knew how hurtful bad the time was spent by the major part of the
						students, being afraid of falling into the same trade Soon after my arrival
						the late brother Daer baum went with me to the meetings of edification, held
						by the Rev<hi rend="superscript">d </hi>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
						Brumhards Here I heard for the first time of Jesus readiness to receive the
						poorest and most miserable sinners which proved to me, a word worthy of
						acceptation. After the meeting I went to my lodgings and cast myself at the
						feet of the friend of sinners, entrea ting Him with many tears to have mercy
						upon me, and to assure me of my being accepted of him by delivering me from
						the dominions of sin in soul and body which had been on for some time a most
						grievous burthen to me. He caused me to look in <note type="catchword"

					<p> that moment believingly to Him, in a manner as I had never been able to do,
						and I felt that sin had been laimed maimed and lost its force. Declining the
						propo sal of my Father, to return home and to accept of a living, he
						withdrew his asistance, which on the one hand obliged me to find my support
						by teaching frensh but set me on the other hand at liberty from accepting my
						father&apos;s proposal con trary to the dictates of my heart. Christian <add
							place="above">Renatus de</add> Zinzendorf coming in the year 1737 under
						the care of John Nitchman, to Jena, I had the pleasure to be his teacher in
						music and the frensh language. About easter the same year the late ordinar
						travelling through Jena, he had an enteview with all those who were employed
						to teach his son, and asked every one, after he had first spoke with each of
						us separately: Wether we were willing to devote ourselves <note
							type="catchword">to</note>
					</p>
					<p> to our Saviour and the Congregation, and <add place="above"
						>were</add>desirous to be prepared for serving our Saviour Every one said
						yes. But the question being put to me, I answered: &quot;I am convinced that
						I ought to devote myself to our Saviour, and to be converted to him with my
						whole heart, for not doing it will render me an unfortunate man. But to be
						devoted to the Congregation I do not understand.&quot; He replied: &quot;It
						is very well, this matter is only for such as understand it, meanwhile you
						may continue to instruct my son&quot;. In June of the same year our Saviour
						was pleased to convince me, in a most striking manner of my call of to the
						brethren&apos;s church, which time I never shall forget. Till now I thought
						as is common in my circumstances, that I was bound in duty to serve my
						native country, which had prevented me from to <note type="catchword"

					<p> see or attend to our Saviour&apos;s views with me. Previous to my going to
						doctor Hamburgers lectures upon natural philosophy, I meditated about myself
						and prayed to our Saviour, who was pleased to speak to my heart and to lead
						me into a serious consideration concerning my past and future course. The
						following questions were brought home to my heart: &quot;What will become of
						you at last and in what manner will your studies terminate? You can&apos;t
						stay always at the university. If you become a minister in your native
						country what benefit will it be of to you on others; for if you go without
						being sent by me, you will be an unprofitable servant, and it may terminate
						with you as with other awa- kened students who did not prosper.&quot; It you
						will save your soul take refuge to the brethrens congregation&quot; &amp;c.
						These and <note type="catchword">other</note>
					</p>
					<p> others considerations came with such clearness into my heart as if our
						Saviour was pre sent and speaking to me, and I was en abled to acquiesce and
						say amen to all, with my whole heart. Now I knew what I was about, heard and
						saw every thing in another light, and my eye being single the whole body was
						light, so that I could not help wondering at the change wrought in me. I
						moved with the consent of John Nitchman in the month of July into the <add
							place="above">house</add> of of the young count, and which was
						exceedingly happy in the company of the brethren. John Nitchman was betrued
						and respected as a father among us, and cared for the good of our souls with
						much love and faithfulness. Our main view was to become like little
						children, and such a spirit of love and zeal prevailed among us, that we sat
						many a night <note type="catchword">till</note>

					<p> state of our souls and singing praises to him, who had chosen us from before
						the foundation of the world, and called us from among the confusion of the
						learned world to his people, and to whom we now wished to devote ourselves,
						with heart felt joy as living sacrifices. In the year 1733 we went with the
						young count to Berlin where his father resided, having about 70 pil grims
						with him. This was a blessed time for me. The singing of the brethren and
						Sisters and the discourses of the late ordinary were attended with unction
						and the demons tration of the spirit of God. Feb<hi rend="superscript"

						given me striking proofs of his Grace, I was yet subject to many changes.
						This true foundation <note type="catchword">was</note>
					</p>
					<p> was laid in my heart, and I was delivered from sin. But being ignorant of
						the previ ledges our Saviour&apos;s patients are intitled to, I perplexed
						myself often at feeling my innate depravity and did not know how to look
						upon it. But now it pleased the friend of my soul to remove this by gran
						ting me the favor to cast a believing look upon Him as my all sufficient
						Saviour; for being at the comn Liturgy in deep and grate ful meditation
						concerning the great favor I had enjoyed in eating and drinking the flesh
						and blood of the son of man sacramentally, and sighing to him, to make me
						quite happy; he appeared in<add place="above">such</add> a most striking
						manner to my heart as my bleeding and suffering Redeemer, that I melted into
						tears like wax before the fire. From that time I proceeded from grace to
						grace and the connexion with Him any beloved Lord whose <note

					<p> love had captivated my heart became daily more confident, and my gracious

						where the testimony of Jesu&apos;s Blood approved itself as the power of God
						to salvation upon many students and others. In the year 1739 we were called
						to Wetteravia, which proved a means to bring me to the Cong<hi
							rend="superscript">n</hi> at Marien born. July the 1<hi
							rend="superscript">st</hi> the late Ordinary arrived from S<hi
							rend="superscript">t</hi> Thomas in the Westindies. As soon as he had
						saluted me he said: &quot;My brother I have spoken to our Saviour concerning
						you, whilst I was at sea. He has ordered me to mention to you in his name,
						that you are to go to Pensylvania to preach the gospel in the whole
						country.&quot; I replied: "Here I am may he do with me what is wellpleasing

						the late ordinary to a Synodal conf<hi rend="superscript">ce</hi> held at
						Ebersdorf. Short- ly before my setting out on my intended post, he put me to
						a very severe but blessed trial by saying <add place="above">before all
							present</add> &quot;Our brother Molter is now going to Pensylvania,
						there he&apos;ll perhaps meet with books wrote against us, or hear many bad

						I can assertain, that before I prove unfaithful to the Cong<hi

						At this declara tion I could not refrain from tears. my answer removed his

					<p> went to Herrnhut, where I was much struck with the primitive simplicity of
						the place and the singing of all the single brethren who were just going in
						procession through the place when I arrived. Having enjoy ed many blessings
						during my abode there I returned to Marrienborn, where every thing relative
						to my future plan was settled and I was married to Johanna de Seydewir on
						the 5<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of sept<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. As
						circumstances required my setting out without her, she it was resolved that
						she should follow me, with the next company that was to go to America.
							Sept<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> the 23<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> I
						sat out and arrived at London Oct. the 18<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. As
						no ship was to sail <add place="above">to Pensylvania</add>till the middle
						of Jany I endeavoured to spend my time as useful as I could, and kept
						meetings to a member of Germans who had been awakened by means of the
						testimony of brother Richter, who <del>was</del><add place="above">had</add>
						de parted this life at Algier. to the english <note type="catchword"
							>brethren</note>
					</p>
					<p> brethren and Sisters. I kept meetings in the Latin language, having some
						body who inter pacted what I said into english, till I after sometime
						ventured to deliver discour ses in the E. language. There was at that time a
						Society at Fetterlane which was begun by b<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>.
						Peter Boehler and was then cared for by the Rev<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>
						John &amp; charles Wesly. As these people did not rightly know what they
						were at they were come into a strange fanatical way, so that I did not know
						what to think when I came for the first time into their mee tings and heard
						them sigh grown and howl in a very strange manner, which they cal led the
						demonstration of the spirit and the power of God. at speaking with the indi
						viduals of this society, I found many deeply concerned for their souls. As
						deficient as I was in expressing myself in the E. Language, they pressed me
						so <note type="catchword">hard.</note>
					</p>

				<div type="page" n="8">

					<pb xml:id="Ful_3_04_MoltherPhilipHenry-15.jpg" n="8"/>
					<p> Seeing that he could not obtain his aim he declined all further fellowship
						with the Society, and <del>stood</del>
						<add place="above">rising</add>from his seat with He walked out with the
						words: &quot;To me, all that are the Lord&apos;s&quot;. Some few followed
						him. Some brethren <add place="above">who</add> gave me an account of what
						had happened, I advised to be still, and to leave the isue to our Saviour.
						In August, I had the joy to welcome my wife here in London, on her way to
						America. It was left to me to let her proceed or keep her with me; but being
						convinced in my heart that it was the will of our Lord that she should go
						thither, and finding her willing to go, I accom panied her on board, where
						we prostrated in prayer before our Saviour and cove nanted with each other
						to be and remain his, after which we took an affectionate leave. In
						September I was recalled <note type="catchword">from</note>
					</p>
					<p> from London to Marrienborn, where having stayed for some time, I was
						commissioned to travel into france in order to look for such as were
						awakened. In Paris I found some godly persons who were mysticks and valued
						the writings of M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Boerignor and Mrs <add
							place="above">Lady</add> de Guion. I also learned that there were a
						great many more of the same people who did not venture to make them selves
						known. From thence I went to Lyon Geneve by way of Lyon, here I stayed with
						the late Ordinary till May and enjoyed many blessings. On my road from
						thence to Holland I fell sick, which necessitated me to stay 10 weeks with
						my mother. I had no patience to wait till I was recovered, and before I
						reached Holland the fever had left me. In Septr I arrived at London, full of
						hopes and joy to pursue my destina tion to Pensylvania, but I was again
						seized <note type="catchword">with</note>

					<p> with another illness, so that my fellow travel lers entered upon their
						voyage without me.  Tho&apos; it did not appear as if I should recover, I
						was informed by a letter that in case of my recovering I was to go against
						to Geneva to serve the awakened souls in that place. After 9 weeks illness I
						sat out for Geneva, where I <add place="above">arrived</add> after an
						agreeable stay of some days at Marien born, in Feb of the year 1742. I had
						not been there above a fortnight when I was ordered by the magistrates, who
						were dissatisfied with my stay there, to quit my private lodgings, and to
						move to an inn. Taking a journey in the coun try I fell sick again &amp; was
						received and treated as a servant of Christ at the house of M<hi
							rend="superscript">r</hi>. Elie Prendhomme, to whom I was  recommended
						by his brother. It proved a great joy to me to see afterwards him and  <note
							type="catchword">his</note>
					</p>
					<p> his whole family, to whom I was is much  indebted, to become children of God
						our Saviour. This was also the <add place="above">case</add>with the family
						of old father Pindent, who at another time served me in the same kind
						manner. About this time I ventured, in reliance upon the help of our Lord,
						to translate our Hymns into the frensh language and in about a years time I
						got 70 of them printed. In April 1743 I returned to Marienborn, where I 
						found my wife, who was arrived from Ame rica a few days before me. I
						received her as if she was given me quite anew by our Saviour. After some
						time we travelled toge ther to the Synod, which was held at Hirsch berg.
						there we were appointed to visit the awakened souls in Switzerland. This
						jour ney proved very agreeable to us both. When we were tired of walking we
						sat down in a lonely spot and sung a verse, feeling excee <note

					<p> dingly well thereat. In a town called Speyer where the whole frensh armee
						was quartered, we had a narrow escape of being killed, being nearly trodden
						under foot, by the horsemen who came from both sides upon us when we were
						just under the gate. In the critical moment, when nothing seemed to offer
						for our relief, I espied a little space between the horses, and snatching my
						wife into my arms I slipped through, wondering at and thanking our Lord for
						his kind protection. Nov 13<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> I settled the in
						habitants of Montmirail-house into a cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> but
						after some time it was broke up again, as we met with opposition in
						Switzerland and were even forbid to reside any more at Geneva. We now
						returned again in July 1745 to Marienborn. In about the time of a year we
						went again into Switzerland, and <add place="above">where besides my former
							office</add> I had also to care for the housekeeping, besides <note
							type="catchword">this</note>
					</p>
					<p> this and the journies into the country I was employed in translating the
							Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> accounts into the frensh language, as
						also with revi sing the hymns I had translated sometime ago and adding more
						hymns to them, which labour proved a refreshment to my heart. As
						circumstances required again our remo val from Montmirail, we met in the
						hall for the last time to thank our Saviour for all the grace he had given
						us to enjoy in this place. I arrived at Herrnhaag (in company of the frensh
						brethren and Sisters from Montmirail) in the last days of sept<hi
							rend="superscript">r</hi> of the year 1748. My stay here was not
						agreeable to me, as I did not like the then course of that cong<hi
							rend="superscript">n</hi>. I therefore kept retired and in stillness.
						These circumstances caused me to search my own heart thoroughly, the
						conclusion of which was, that our Lord was plea sed to give me a renewed
						impression of my <note type="catchword">election</note>

					<p> election of grace. In 1749 we were in Holland and England with the late
						ordinary, in whose house we spent the time very blessedly In 1750 we went to
						Barby, in hopes that the frensh brethren and sisters who were obliged to
						emigrate with the rest of the b<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> and s<hi
							rend="superscript">rs</hi> from Herrnhaag, would find it prac ticable to
						settle there. Meanwhile the Count of Neuwied altered to receive them in his
						Dominions and to grant them liberty of conscience. The late Ordinary having
						had an interview with the count of Neu wied, previous to his arival at
						Barby, he acquainted me, that he had found a place for the frensh b<hi
							rend="superscript">rn</hi> &amp; s<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> and
						viz: Neuwied, and told me to prepare for my journey thither. In sept<hi
							rend="superscript">r</hi> I went to Herrnhaag and from thence with some
						of the frensh brethren and sisters to Neuwied, where we arrived Oct the
							16<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. Soon after the remain <note

					</p>
					<p> der of them <del>frensh</del> brethren &amp; Sisters arrived with us, after
						which we all partook of the holy Com<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> at which
						our Saviours grace was power ful among us. We lived at first together in one
						house as one family. Love, simplicity, and grace and truth ruled among us,
						and He who regardeth the ready and poor, walked in our midst and the peace
						of God rested upon this cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>. What trials of
						faith and patience we had to experience during the first 4 years is only
						known to our Saviour, but his faithfulness and support was our only
						dependence. These trials were the conse quence of our moving to Neuwied
