					The course of life of the S. S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sarah Skelton who departed
					to our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> May 3 1778 in the S<hi rend="superscript">isr</hi> House at Fulneck
					she has felt the following acco<add place="above">u</add>nt of hersilf. </p>
					<p>
					I was born at Robert Town in the parish of Burstoll,
					Yorkshire and baptiz&apos;d in the Ch: of Eng: in my 5<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> year
					my Mother departed this life, my Father being left with 
					5 small Children, sent me to live with one of my
					relations; and remov&apos;d himself with the rest of the Family
					to Pudsey: in about a year after, he took one home again
					that I might have the oppertunity with the rest of the Children
					to go to the meetings at Fulneck, which I did with great
					pleasure for a time when I was about 10 years ould, I begun
					to love the things of this world, and forgot in a great measure
					what I had heard of our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> in the meetings. I then left my
					Father, and went to service: which indeed prov&apos;d hurtfull
					to me being led by others into very bad things, and foll
					owing at the same time my own evil inclinations, but
					my faithfull Saviour kept a gracious eye over me, and
					let me feel, that if I went on in this way I shou&apos;d be 
					lost forever. My M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> with whome I liv&apos;d, did not like
					me to go to the meetings, but I intreated her one day very
					earnestly, she gave me leave, I then went to my Father
					and laid my case before him, and tould him, I could live
					there no longer, disireing him to take me home again, 
					which he did: I then cou&apos;d go to the meetings at Fulne<add place="above">ck</add>
					of which I was very glad in my 13th yr I was receivd into 
					the G: Girls Choir and from that time our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> begun
					a new work of Grace in my heart, he let me feel what
					a poor lost creature I was by nature, I wept for grace

			<p>
					and wanted to be his intirely, I soon got a strong desire to 
					go and live with the Sis<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>, but durst not make it known,
					thinking I was too bad; but when I cou&apos;d conceal it no longer
					I ventured to tell my Father, he gave me no incouragement
					at all: but as I cou&apos;d not give it up, I speak to my Labouress
					about it, who promisd not to forget me as it was a 
					good while before I got leave to go, and I was weak and 
					unsteady in mysilf; the things of this world took again
					hold of me, and provd a temptation to me in many
					respects but my dear Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> never left me, but let me
					feel I was not right, and causd me to be very uneasy
					about my poor Soul, so that I coud do nothing but pray
					him to make out a way for any escape, from the many
					snares and temptation which were in my way.</p>
					<p>
					March 25<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1770 I obtaind leave to go and live with
					the S. S<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> at Gumersall, for which I was very thank
					full, and now it was my only desire to prosper in the
					Cong<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> to learn more of mysilf an also to become more
					acquainted with our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Feb<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> 23<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> 1772 I had the
					favour to be recievd into the Congr which was a great
					comfort to me. May 4<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1773 I was receivd into the S 
					S<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Choir; this change prov&apos;d both a blessing and a 
					of heart to me, I felt more of my corrupted state
					by nature, but being very close, and not willing to 
					be known as I really was: hinderd our Sav<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> work 
					in my heart, yet I felt him constantly busy to 
					bring me to the knowledge of himsilf as the Found
					of poor sinners, but instead of coming to him
				
			</p>
			<p>
					as a poor Sinner, I stood looking at mysilf so long till
					my misery became greater, it was to me as if all the sins I
					had ever been guilty of, were laid before my eyes, and I 
					became quite dark and perplex&apos;d: and thought I had better
					leave the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> then be known just as I was; for I thought, 
					certainly no one has ever been like me, when I wou&apos;d have
					turnd to our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> it was as if something stood between, so
					that I knew not which way to turn for relief for my poor
					distressed Soul. Nov<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> 28<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1773 I had the favour to be a 
					spectator at the H: Comunion: which I took as a proof
					of our Sav<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> love to me, that I might know he had not
					forgot me; even when I thought I was forsaken of all, 
					and what a feeling I had of his precious nearness
					during that transaction, I can never describe in words;
					this encoraged me so that I coud go on chearfull for some
					time, but the feeling of my misery still oppressd me,
					for it was nor made quite dear to me that I had hinder&apos;d
					our Sav<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> work by my own striving, and silf? working, at
					the time when he wanted to bring one to a clearness in
					him and I felt (by the fresh discovery he gave me of my
					great misery and wretchedness) that he was now quite
					intent to do it, and as I cou&apos;d now do no otherwise, I disclosd
					my whole heart to my Labouress; whome I found so tender
					and sympathizing that I was quite asham&apos;d. sometime after
					having not yet feelt our Sav<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> forgiveness I came into
					darkness and confusion about it, and was not without
					thoughts of leaving the Congn being continually distress
					on account of my many sins, which I longd to have
					blotted out: and be absolvd from.

			<p>
					in this longing disposition I once retird alone, and prostrated before
					our Savr and he appear&apos;d before me in that bleeding figure as he
					hang upon the Cross, and gave me the asureance that he had
					forgiven one all my sins, this was a comfort which no words
					can describe; thus I became chearfull and was thankfull for 
					what I had injoyd. and I feelt an inexpressable desire to be a
					participant of the H: Communion, which grace I was made
					a pertakes off, Feb<hi rend="superscript">y</hi> 18<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1776 to my great joy, from this time
					I gave mysilf up intirely to our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>, and wish&apos;d for nothing so
					much as to live in a close connesion with him, till I shall see
					him face to face, - so for her own words --- Since she had the 
					favour to be a partaker of the Body and Blood of our Savr in the
					H: Commuion she was very strict with hersilf: the sense she had of her
					own poverty made her always timerous, least any thing shou&apos;d 
					creep in between our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> and her, and when ever the smallest thing
					did; she cou&apos;d never be easy till it was want&apos;d away by the Blood of
					our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> which had once given her pardon: This watchfullness over
					hersilf prov&apos;d the means of her keeping in a close conexion with her
					unseen friend; she was for some years past at times very sickly, and 
					towards the latter end of last year, she got a bad cold and cough;
					which never rightly left her tho&apos; severall means was try&apos;d for that
					purpose, Jan<hi rend="superscript">ry</hi> 18 1778 she mov&apos;d to Fulneck to see if change of air
					wou&apos;d not be of servise to her; but she was soon abliged to move
					into the Sickroom her sickness terminating in a Consumption;
					it was soon clear to her that our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> was hastening to prepare her 
					for himsilf: and tho&apos; at times she wish&apos;d to recover, yet she soon resignd
					hersilf to the will of our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> that he might do with her as he
					thought best, and so spent her time in the Sickroom in a tender childlike
					hearts conexion with him in her last days here below, she rejoic&apos;d at the
					happy prospect she had in view, often praying that the time might soon
					come, it was very agreeable to be near her the peace of our Savr so surr
					ounded her, it was likewise a pleasure to her to be visited by the Sisters to
					whome she often tould how she long&apos;d to go to her everlasting rest
					which longing desire was happily fulfild May ye 3d in the morning
