               <p>I was born at <placeName>Northarm in the parish of Halifax</placeName> in the year <date type="birth" when-iso="1722-05-29"><add>May 29</add> 1722</date>. My Parents being very
                  religious endeavour'd to bring me up strictly in the fear of <persName type="diety">God</persName>. they very early perceiving my natural turn to be <del>???</del> quick livly and
                  active, on that account took the greater care of me takeing me with them constantly to the <orgName>Decenters</orgName> meetings, as I at that time did not understand their meaning,
                  I look upon it as being very hardly dealt with, but afterwards san clearly that their intentions where only to prevent my entrance on a very loose course of life which I might have
                  fall'n into, had not their unwearied care &amp; faithfullness, been a great means of preserving me, together with an invisible Hand, which I often felt while very young over me
                  without any knowlidge of the meaning thereof for which I shall forever remain thankfull, I went on much in this way till <persName>Mr Inham</persName> came to these parts, to whose
                  preaching the greatest part of the people resorting, I went among the rest, being thereby stir'd up &amp; often brought to reflect on my state, but with out any lasting impression. I
                  remember one night being very thoughtfull when going to bed, I dream'd that I was to be put to death, at which I was very much perplex't, I intreated to be spar'd while I was set to
                  die. The earnestness I was in awoke me, but the impression of this I never lost, &amp; by means of the uncom- mon feelings I had somtimes I thought surly there was some thing to be
                  injoy'd, to which I was as yet a stranger, but was not rightly satisfy'd to be without it. In the <date when-iso="1744" cert="low">year 17</date> the <orgName>Brethern</orgName>
                  <del>???</del><!-- see note in Daily Log gogogle doc -->
                  <add>came</add> into <placeName ref="#mlpla000084">Yorkshire</placeName> with a vein <del>intention</del> to settle societies, accordingly tookdown the names of those who constantly
                  atended the preaching. I therefore was willing to have mine taken down, which was no sooner done, but I was amazingly struck, thinking I am now however fast, but did not repent it. I
                  soon found it was not done the taking down the </p>

               <p>ames but they entended to look more particularly after each one therefore they soon settled Bands to which I was admitted &amp; geting a great <name type="emotion">love</name> for
                  them they were very much bless to me. Some of my Companions being soon after this receiv'd into the <orgName>Congregation</orgName> it Cause'd me many uneasy hours, as I was left,
                  however I thought to try &amp; get to them though I knew not how to set about it, when almost dispairing I often felt exceedingly encouraged and very much strengthened I was not
                  allow'd to go to the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> meetings this drove me to the determination to make my mind known which I did by a letter to the Cong<hi rend="superscript"
                     >n</hi> expressing my greatest desire to be embody'd with them. My request was soon granted our in year <date when-iso="1745">1745</date> this was an inex- -pressible grace &amp;
                  favour to me past discribing being then very chearfull I thought I had then got all that could make my happiness compleat. In this way I went on for some time. In the year <date
                     when-iso="1747">1747</date> the first <orgName en="Å“conomy">Sis<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Oeconomy</orgName> was settl'd at <placeName>Oxhaighs</placeName> I having the favour to be one of
                  the first, I look'd on it &amp; accepted it with a real thankfull heart, &amp; the blessing which I then enjoy'd well never be forgot by me. This <name type="emotion"
                     >happiness</name> lasted for some time but before I was aware it all vanishd away and I was left as much distresst as ever being ready to determin to leave the
                     <orgName>Sisrs</orgName> &amp; take my thing in the world but my Consionec would not permit me to such on this account I often whr'd to a lonly place, which I had found quite to
                  my mind, then I often lamented my state without the least hopes of being helpt through, &amp; sav'd at last but my best &amp; faithfull friend notwithstanding my negligence followed
                  me endeavouring to bring me to the place where I at all times bught to have a remaind er at his feet, he thererfore took an Oppertunity to shen me my state by nature &amp; convincd
                  me that noself working would avail me any thing, but he was willing to take my care on himself. I was hereby quite overcome, by his asuring me I was his, which so worked on me that I
                  was determin'd to be his intirly with soul &amp; body, and as a poor Sinner to receive grace at his hand. </p>

               <p>My longing was now daily increased to become a partaker of the <name event="sacrament">Holy Sacrement</name> which grace was granted me <date when-iso="1747-11">Nov
                     1747</date> after which I believd simply I should yeild more satisfaction to the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> &amp; my self. These thoughts brought me into a very loyal way
                  but could not with my best endeavours effect what I wish for, and having no Laboress at that time to help &amp; encourage as, I thought to direct myself, but not being able this way
                  only brought me into confusion. At last I was convinc'd that even those who were partakers of his body &amp; blood could lay up no store without a daily &amp; hourly supply from the
                  fountain from whence all good springs. Therefore I determin'd to be directed and influenced alone by him who has often approv'd himself as my friend in need. Chearfully &amp;
                  satisfy'd then there being a new <orgName en="Å“conomy">Oeconomy</orgName> began at <placeName ref="#mlpla000052">Littlemoore</placeName>. I was one that was place'd there where I learnd to know
                  mroe of myself and the leading of our <persName type="diety">Saviour</persName> with me then I was sensible of before. In the <date when-iso="1750">year 50</date> I mov'd again to
                  the <orgName en="Å“conomy">Oeconomy</orgName> at <placeName>Conhouse</placeName>, where I thought to live Chearfully with the rest of my Companions. But here I must observe I was again disturb'd
                  by my own Corruption of which I thought I had sufficient knowledge <add>before</add> but found the depth of my natural Corrupted heart was unfathomable which made me almost conclude
                  it was uppossible for me to be help to the end of days <del>?????????</del>. I was often encouraged by those about me to believe I was not to bad for our Sav<hi rend="superscript"
                     >r</hi> but to not purpose, till I felt it scals &amp; made clear to my heart by my best friend. He often took such oppertunities as these to melt &amp; bow my heart before him
                  amen, &amp; thereby to make my call &amp; diction of grace of greater value to me. The same year the <orgName en="Å“conomy">Oeconomy</orgName> mov'd to <placeName ref="#mlpla000003"
                     >Fulneck</placeName> there to reside till the <placeName>Choir house</placeName> which was their <del>in</del> building,</p>

                  <persName type="diety">Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></persName> and partook of the grace which in a particular manner prevail'd at that time. here as well as in all other places

                  <add>notwithstanding</add> all failings wants &amp; defects I was alway follow'd and often comforted by him who has alway approv'd himself as my only effectual Comforter &amp; Sav<hi

                  as it was thought best I went out of Obedience at which place I was receiv'd with so much love &amp; heartiness as I can't express but I have often reflected on it with
                  thankfullness, so far Her own words but meeting with difficulties of various sorts, the employment for which I went there not answering the wish for end, and having a great desire to
